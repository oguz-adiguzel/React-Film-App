# About The Project

A movie site project using ReactJS and Bootstrap and using Netflix's design. The project has 2 types of user login as 'admin' and 'user' with username and password. With the 'Admin' entry, it is possible to add movies to the system and delete movies from the system. 'User' entry can only see the movie in the system and add and remove it from the list. 

'Json-Server' is used as 'localhost' in the project and it is running on port 3001. Users, movie list, and user movie list are kept in this 'Json-Server' file.
